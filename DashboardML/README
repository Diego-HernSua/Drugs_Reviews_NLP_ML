How to run the Dashboard:
    python dashboard.py 
or python3, depending on your system. Make sure you have installed all the necessary packages!

Then follow the webpage listed in the output, most likely (possibly another port):
    http://127.0.0.1:8050/

In case there is an error concerning the version of scikit-learn, execute the following commands:
    pip uninstall scikit-learn
    pip install scikit-learn==1.2.2

This is necessary to import a pickle file with the data for the graphs, obtained from our main notebook.
This notebook was run on google colab, which has an older version of scikit-learn.
