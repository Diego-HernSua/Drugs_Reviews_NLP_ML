I find it can also be used as needed along with the daily treatment.","I really don't have any side effects other than the mild but very tolerable issue of taking it 4-5 times a day which isn't an effect but just the way you need to take this. At first, within the first 1 day then couple of weeks after starting, this medicine is broken down by your body fast and you need to adjust your dose.

At first I wished to only take them as needed but with my doctor's advice, he was right. This really does work when you take it daily at 3-5 times per day. This way your body adjusts to what's going on with the panic and makes no association with taking a pill to prevent or stop it, they just don't start in the first place. Yes, I still do have minor attacks and worry episodes here and there but nothing at all like the many years before this. I wish that this extremely helpful medicine would not have such a bad name in media, news and pharmacies. This works wonders and there is no want or need to take more or become and addict.

I did turn very, very red around the perioral area and especially at the nasolabial folds.  My face felt as if I needed to peel it off and scratch deep down in the dermis.

However, I'm several years out from treatment , and I still have dry skin problems.  It's weird because my skin was always so oily and now it's dry.  But that could be attributed to normal aging.  Regardless, I've become a real connosiour of facial moisturizers.  My skin is also a little more sensitive post isotretinoin.

So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose.","I was surprised to experience brief blinding headaches in the upper left rear quadrant of my head, like a mini seconds-long burst of pressure that felt like a blunt object suddenly trying to explode out of my skull.

Possibly the worst side effect I experienced was a DECREASE in motivation.  If you read above, you may have noticed that one of the two reasons I sought treatment was to increase my motivation.  I had a hard time keeping my house clean and getting started on tasks.  Well, within two weeks of starting this medication, I began needing long naps (3+ hours) every day just to function.  I watched TV for the rest of the day.  I had no interest in work and basically messed around all day instead of working.  It was a severe decrease in motivation.

Actiq relaxes the body and the brain becomes numb and able to handle ongoing pain effectively.  It is fast acting in the subcutaneous, ""lollipop"" form and within minutes you are comfortable.

The flavor is also quite pleasant.","Actiq, when taken as directed, induces a feeling of numbness. and slurred speech is common. Thinking becomes confused and it is not unusual to fall asleep in mid-sentence. Actiq slows breathing and causes extreme tiredness.  Actiq are highly addictive and it is literally impossible to stop taking them without a medical detoxification.

Actiq delivered in subcutaneous form causes the teeth to rot after extended use of more than 6 months.","Actiq should only be taken by individuals who are in severe, chronic pain where

tolerance to the drug will not become problematic.  It needs to be closely monitored and locked away out of reach of children or any adult who may have problems with addiction.

My  chronic  pain condition was followed by a Pain Center at a reputable hospital.  The use of opioids were used only after all other treatments for

my condition had failed.

Unfortunately, once Actiq was introduced to me, my medical problems worsened, although my pain was under control.  I was unable to function responsibly, began dealing with symptoms of withdrawal whenever I didn't take it, which at times became worse than my actual pain and discomfort.  I became more of a patient to my family and on a side note, at age 40 lost 4 molars due to the ingredients present in the ""lollipops"" I was taking.

I had no choice but to be hospitalized for an inpatient medical detox in order to safely get this horrible drug out of my body.  Fortunately my husband and I were fortunate enought to have the money to go through this detox program.

I have no memory of 2 years of my life, thanks to an ignorant, negligent doctor and the drug, Actiq.  

Believe it or not, my painful conditions are now completely under control now, and I am able to care for my husband and children, and work!

It was easier to start and finish projects because energy previously wasted on negative thoughts and actions was now available for constructive purposes.,"A total loss of any sexual sensation.  Prior to treatment interest in sex was low but paradoxically, when a feeling of psychological well-being produced a renewed interest in sex, the drug also removed the physical ability to engage in it.  Orgasm was impossible and physical arousal was too weak to be effective. 

The worst part was withdrawal following treatment.  It took at least 6 months of extremely gradual tapering off to withdraw, and I was on a low dose.  Any attempt to withdraw faster would produce chaotic mood swings from hysterical laughter to violent, yelling rages.  Every emotion, however mild, was magnified exponentially.  Sexual sensation also went off the scale with such hypersensitivity that ejaculations happened spontaneously without any physical stimulation - a sneeze or a yawning stretch would morph into an immediate ejaculating orgasm without any erection.  Throughout the withdrawal period a sensation of electric brain shocks extending to the arms and trunk would accompany any quick eye movement.","Just the one pill each morning.

I tried counseling and medications like Zoloft and Lexapro. The side effects from those made me feel worse than I did just not taking them.



Finally my doctor decided to put me on Alprazolam as-needed. 



It has been a life-saver for me. I would take the lowest dose (0.25 mg), and be able to leave my house for the first time in months. I visited friends, went to restaurants, and did everything I used to do before my disorder. I finally felt like I had my life back. I would take one whenever I anticipated a situation where I could have an attack, or when I felt one coming on already. Sometimes I didn't even need all of the 0.25 mg and could break it in half. 



Too many people abuse this medication by upping their dosage without a doctor's consent or using it when they don't need to, and now you are almost treated like a criminal at some pharmacies and doctor's offices when they learn you are taking it because they think you are a druggie.



I *much* prefer this medication over any of the SSRIs, which have horrible side effects. I felt like a zombie on those medications, had no sex drive at all, and didn't have any energy whatsoever. The doctors tell you those side effects will go away with use, but for days to even weeks you feel 10 times worse than you did before. It's just not worth it.



0.25 mg of Alprazolam as-needed for anxiety has helped me get my life back on track and really helped save me from spending days and nights locked away in my house. I highly recommend this medication for responsible people who just need something in a crutch and don't want to go on long-term SSRIs that leave you feeling drained and lifeless.



Yes, counseling and therapy are a better alternative to medication, but the problem is always finding a *good* counselor, and sometimes even then, they just don't work. I have seen 3 counselors and all of them have failed to help me with anything, all I did was waste a $20 copay each visit to have them tell me things that sounded like they came from an inspirational booklet.

My doctor prescribed me a 1mg tablet to take 2 of them in the morning and 2 at night at the onset of a cold sore.  It helped but the sore still ran its ugly course, even if I caught it right at the tingling point before it came out.  When I was 38, I went on birth control.  After about a year of being on Yaz, I began getting cold sores EVERY MONTH!  I told my doctor but she didn't think it was from the birth control - even though I read that BC suppresses your immune system, and anything that does that can allow for more instances of cold sores.  I went off the Yaz for 2 months, and STILL got cold sores during those two months.  So maybe she was right.  She then prescribed Valtrez 500mg once per day and I've been taking that since 9/09.  Still, like clockwork I get a cold sore every single month.  Either right before during or after my period.  So I think it's hormonal.  something is triggering them every month.  I've changed my diet completely, I take 4,000mg of Lsyine each day, I've tried the Red Marine Algae also.  No difference.  I'm a high stress personality anyway which doesn't help.  My doctor prescribed a mild sedative just to take the edge off and it does work great.  But still, the cold sores come like clockwork.  I just don't get it.  I'm starting a new job soon where I'll actually have to go to an office each day.  for the last 10 years I've been a road warrior, so I've been able to get around having to see people by making my own hours, especially if a cold sore errupts.

661,suboxone,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,opioid addiction,"Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:



1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.



2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.



Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 



Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life.","My only major complaint is that since Suboxone is an opioid (though different from Heroin, Oxy, etc.) it causes constipation. 



Due to Suboxone's opioid blocking effect, if pain medication were needed in a hospital emergency setting, there could be complications. If I came in to the ER with a broken arm and they gave me a shot of Morphine, it would do absolutely nothing. Though this hasn't been an issue for me yet.","I am a drug addict, and although I went to rehab to get off of opiate drugs I just couldn't seem to stop. So I went on Suboxone, which is a new alternative to Methadone treatment.



While Methadone is a normal agonist opioid ('agonist' means it gets use high) it can be dispensed to drug addicts to keep them from withdrawing from their drug of choice because the Methadone lasts so long. But Methadone must be taken every day at a clinic and cannot be taken home, addicts can STILL use drugs while on Methadone if they choose too, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get off of, and Methadone still gets users high.



Suboxone is a great alternative because it can be prescribed and bought at the pharmacy so you can take it at home, it takes care of your drug cravings but it doesn't get you high (not exactly, anyways, but it does satisfy the Opiate Receptors enough) and it's really not all THAT hard to get off of if you must (the withdrawals are are VERY manageable).","['suboxone', 'beneficial', 'two', 'reason', '1', 'eliminated', 'opiate', 'withdrawal', 'wa', 'original', 'drug', 'choice', '2', 'maintenance', 'drug', 'suboxone', 'eliminates', 'craving', 'would', 'normally', 'well', 'block', 'effect', 'oxycodone', 'etc', 'take', 'drug', 'instead', 'every', 'day', 'avoid', 'taking', 'drug', 'terrible', 'thing', 'come', 'active', 'addiction', 'take', 'suboxone', 'move', 'life', 'suboxone', 'may', 'quite', 'literally', 'saved', 'life']","['major', 'complaint', 'since', 'though', 'different', 'etc', 'cause', 'constipation', 'due', 'effect', 'pain', 'medication', 'needed', 'hospital', 'emergency', 'could', 'came', 'er', 'broken', 'arm', 'gave', 'shot', 'would', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'though', 'ha', 'issue', 'yet']","['drug', 'although', 'went', 'get', 'opiate', 'drug', 'could', 'seem', 'stop', 'went', 'new', 'alternative', 'methadone', 'treatment', 'methadone', 'normal', 'mean', 'get', 'use', 'high', 'drug', 'keep', 'drug', 'choice', 'methadone', 'last', 'long', 'methadone', 'must', 'taken', 'every', 'day', 'clinic', 'cannot', 'taken', 'home', 'still', 'use', 'drug', 'methadone', 'choose', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'get', 'methadone', 'still', 'get', 'user', 'high', 'great', 'alternative', 'prescribed', 'bought', 'pharmacy', 'take', 'home', 'take', 'care', 'drug', 'craving', 'doe', 'get', 'high', 'exactly', 'doe', 'opiate', 'receptor', 'enough', 'really', 'hard', 'get', 'must', 'withdrawal', 'manageable']"

On the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.

In my case I did not want to return to the doctors office and be charged again for another consultation + purchase additional amoxilin as I was not covered by medical insurance at that time.

Instead I went to a local pharmacy with the package of antibiotics I received from the doctors office and asked if I could buy 12 tablets. They were more than happy to sell them to me (at a fraction of the cost I paid at the doctors office) and I followed through with a 7 day course.

Valtrex is an amazing drug!



My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 

partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.

Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.

2618,buprenorphine,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,major depression,"Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:

     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.

     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.

     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.

     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication.",None.,I take two 8mg tablets in the afternoon by putting them under my tongue and allowing them simply to dissolve.

Still cannot breath. I am now bent over with my hands on my knees struggling to intake air. I took several more puffs from the inhaler. No effect.

The recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient, but I found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my IBS symptoms.

The effects, compared to when I was in the episode I'm very stable. Occasional bouts of mild, often topical depression, but otherwise okay. 

As for insomnia, it's gotten to the point where I'm almost dependent on it to sleep. Considering beforehand, even while not in a noted phase I would have serious problems sleeping, this is a welcome effect.","I'm very slow to get going in the morning. I often hit my snooze alarm 10-12 times (only 5 minutes a piece), but that could also stem from setting my alarm 3 hours before I have to be anywhere.



The worst problem of it all is that it stuffs up my sinuses to the point where I can't breathe through them when getting to sleep. Combine that with dry mouth and you get some very uncomfortable nights. I've found that keeping a supply of corn chips and water next to my bed counteracts the dry mouth until I go unconscious and stop caring.



Also, something which I'm not sure if I can blame the seroquel for; I sometimes get very mild but discomforting pains just under my left collarbone.

1592,xanax,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,anxiety/depression,"I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.","lethargy, loss of appetite.","I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily.

592,sulindac,4,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects,baker's cysts behind both knees,"After about a week, I started to see a small reduction in the size of the fluid-filled cysts behind my knees.  Over the 3-week treatment period, there was about a 25 percent reduction in the size of the cysts. There was also a mild reduction in the pain associated with the cysts. 



Another benefit was that I did not get upper GI pain & bleeding with this med, whereas NSAIDs had been causing black stools due to GI irritation & bleeding.","Within about 30 minutes of taking each dose of Sulindac, I experienced a colicky pain under my ribs on the right side.  The pain was not extreme, but it was noticeable and unpleasant.  Duration lasted 2 - 4 hours each time.  This side effect persisted throughout the entire treatment period.","Due to longstanding knee osteoarthritis, I am prone to fluid-filled cysts on the backside of my knees.  The cysts cause pain, swelling, and reduced circulation to the lower leg.  The cysts interfere with walking gait as well.



In past I had used NSAIDs to reduce the inflammation of these cysts, however due to NSAID-related side effects, this class of drug was put off-limits by my physician.  His recommendation was that I try a drug in the pro-NSAID class, which is less irritating to the stomach.



In retrospect, I think that for me, the Sulindac was a trade-off: less stomach irritation exchanged for liver irritation with the Sulindac.  Due to this side-effect, my doctor reduced frequency of medication to once per day.  My response to the Sulindac was less robust than I had hoped for -- much less improvement than I had experienced previously with NSAIDs -- and it also took a long time (3 weeks) to reach the level of improvement that in past I would achieve in 3 days with OTC NSAIDs.","['week', 'started', 'see', 'small', 'reduction', 'size', 'fluid', 'filled', 'cyst', 'behind', 'knee', '3', 'week', 'treatment', 'period', 'wa', '25', 'percent', 'reduction', 'size', 'cyst', 'wa', 'also', 'mild', 'reduction', 'pain', 'associated', 'cyst', 'another', 'benefit', 'wa', 'get', 'upper', 'gi', 'pain', 'bleeding', 'med', 'whereas', 'causing', 'black', 'stool', 'due', 'gi', 'irritation', 'bleeding']","['within', '30', 'minute', 'taking', 'dose', 'experienced', 'pain', 'rib', 'right', 'side', 'pain', 'wa', 'extreme', 'wa', 'noticeable', 'unpleasant', 'duration', 'lasted', '2', '4', 'hour', 'time', 'side', 'effect', 'throughout', 'entire', 'treatment', 'period']","['due', 'knee', 'fluid', 'filled', 'cyst', 'knee', 'cyst', 'pain', 'swelling', 'reduced', 'lower', 'leg', 'cyst', 'interfere', 'walking', 'well', 'past', 'used', 'reduce', 'inflammation', 'cyst', 'however', 'due', 'related', 'side', 'effect', 'class', 'drug', 'wa', 'put', 'limit', 'physician', 'recommendation', 'wa', 'try', 'drug', 'pro', 'class', 'le', 'irritating', 'stomach', 'think', 'wa', 'le', 'stomach', 'irritation', 'liver', 'irritation', 'due', 'side', 'effect', 'doctor', 'reduced', 'frequency', 'medication', 'per', 'day', 'response', 'wa', 'le', 'much', 'le', 'improvement', 'experienced', 'previously', 'also', 'took', 'long', 'time', '3', 'week', 'reach', 'level', 'improvement', 'past', 'would', 'achieve', '3', 'day', 'otc']"

1067,botox,5,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,for wrinkle (line) reduction,"Botox was administered to help reduce the lines appearing on my forehead and at the outer side of my eyes- crows feet.  The 100 and 50 unit injections were effective in reducing the lines for a period of about 5 months, but there were noticeable adverse reactions with the 100 units.  The 50 units were as effective but without the spasms noted under Treatment Details.  OF the 2 times 50 units were injected,  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended 4 hours.  There was concern of effectiveness, but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective, and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous 50 unit injection.  More detail is covered under the treatment details.","Side effects were twitching of eyes, especially upon smiling,,, spasms of cheeks.  Blurry vision.  This lasted for approximately 3 days.","The first use of botox was 100 units. Injections were 5 injections on the upper-mid forehead. 3 injections were given around the outer side of each eye. Within 2 hours it was difficult to close my eyes.  The forehead was totally stiff. Upon smiling and talking my cheek muscles were noticably twitching.  Eye lids twitched, friends noticed my face spasming.

   I make note of this issue because of the fact concerning the stability of the botox.  I realize that botox is available in 50 or 100 unit vials, which are then reconstituted. The nurse stated that he had to use all of the botox (apparently he only had the 100unit vial)because it would be instable after 4 hours.    

   Since this time, I have had 50units of botox at two different times, injected in the same areas stated above.  There was no adverse spasms, be definite ""freezing"" of the forehead muscles.  The 100 units and 50 units lasted about 4-5 months before lines started to appear again due to frowning, smiling, etc.   I recently had only 10 units injected mid-upper forehead in 2-3 injections. Upon raising my eyebrows I needed (I thought) injections more lower mid section since the upper forehead did not move.  After one month, I find that I have a few lines above my eyebrow but in general, my forehead is less lined.

  My MAIN CONCERN is :  if physicians, agents  have only 50 - 100unit vials available, and they are only injecting 1 client, what do they do with the residual.  Is this why there is such a high cost  $11 - $15 per unit??  It makes me wonder if physicians are freezing or using the botox beyond the 4 hour expiration time.  Have manufacturers ever thought of packaging smaller unit packages to assure clients are getting ""the real"" stuff.  This last physician did not have the manufacturer's bottle for me to see, only a small syringe already pre-filled.","['botox', 'wa', 'administered', 'help', 'reduce', 'line', 'appearing', 'forehead', 'side', 'eye', 'foot', '100', '50', 'injection', 'effective', 'reducing', 'line', 'period', '5', 'month', 'noticeable', 'adverse', 'reaction', '100', '50', 'effective', 'without', 'spasm', 'noted', 'treatment', 'detail', '2', 'time', '50', 'last', 'time', 'botox', 'recommended', '4', 'hour', 'wa', 'concern', 'effectiveness', 'actually', 'seems', 'though', 'botox', 'wa', 'quickly', 'effective', 'seemed', 'effective', 'reducing', 'line', 'previous', '50', 'injection', 'detail', 'covered', 'treatment', 'detail']","['side', 'effect', 'twitching', 'eye', 'especially', 'upon', 'spasm', 'cheek', 'blurry', 'vision', 'lasted', 'approximately', '3', 'day']","['first', 'use', 'botox', 'wa', '100', 'unit', 'injection', '5', 'injection', 'upper', 'mid', 'forehead', '3', 'injection', 'given', 'around', 'outer', 'side', 'eye', 'within', '2', 'hour', 'wa', 'difficult', 'close', 'eye', 'forehead', 'wa', 'totally', 'upon', 'talking', 'cheek', 'muscle', 'eye', 'friend', 'noticed', 'face', 'make', 'note', 'issue', 'fact', 'stability', 'botox', 'realize', 'botox', 'available', '50', '100', 'unit', 'nurse', 'stated', 'use', 'botox', 'apparently', 'would', '4', 'hour', 'since', 'time', 'botox', 'two', 'different', 'time', 'injected', 'area', 'stated', 'wa', 'adverse', 'spasm', 'forehead', 'muscle', '100', 'unit', '50', 'unit', 'lasted', '4', '5', 'month', 'line', 'started', 'appear', 'due', 'etc', 'recently', '10', 'unit', 'injected', 'mid', 'upper', 'forehead', '2', '3', 'injection', 'upon', 'eyebrow', 'needed', 'thought', 'injection', 'lower', 'mid', 'section', 'since', 'upper', 'forehead', 'move', 'one', 'month', 'find', 'line', 'eyebrow', 'general', 'forehead', 'le', 'main', 'concern', 'physician', '50', 'available', '1', 'high', 'cost', '11', '15', 'per', 'unit', 'make', 'wonder', 'physician', 'using', 'botox', 'beyond', '4', 'hour', 'time', 'manufacturer', 'ever', 'thought', 'packaging', 'smaller', 'unit', 'package', 'getting', 'real', 'stuff', 'last', 'physician', 'manufacturer', 'bottle', 'see', 'small', 'syringe', 'already', 'pre', 'filled']"
1459,cymbalta,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,chronic back pain/depression/anxiety,"Hello all !

Through the past two years I was diagnosed with Shuermann's Kyphosis, a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. Throughout the past two years I have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers, Ie. Vicodin ES,Percocet,MS Contin etc.. I knew enough was enough, so like that I stopped taking them. I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro, but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland, and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). Anyways, it has been my third day on this prescription, and I feel like a new person. I find myself enjoying simplistic things, and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. I am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. I am enrolled and taking college courses which I have 2 more semesters left before I receive my degree. In one of my classes (Chemistry) We are assigned a Science experiment. Mine, will be for depression and pain levels which will I am using Cymbalta. I recorded myself for two weeks, and then the first day after each dose of the drug. I am feeling alive, and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. I have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. But for me it is working, and I am consistent in my daily routine. I shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription.","I have no side effects at the moments. This drug is being used for a dual purpose action as stated in my recordings. I feel that this has a mixed review. For me I was given two weeks of trials, and then 10 refills. So my advice to any of you, is to ask your care giver for a sample of any drug you take before you make it a routine pill. It takes 3-6 weeks for a Human to become physically and mentally dependant.

657,seasonique,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,have not stop bleeding,,Bleeding not even Spotting,"Ladies: I am sure you may have done lots of researches by now regarding taking Seasonique (PLEASE do before you try to take this drug), and there are lots of negative than positive comments on this drug. I would like to point out a couple of my comments to share with you. I normally have 4 - 5 days menstrual periods every month. But I was not happy and tried to be on this drug because it described 4 periods only per year (WOW! what a great idea, especially I have small child, school, work, and husband). Guess what happen since then? I have been bleeding almost 2 weeks now, and from light to heavy, the worst part is I get all these uncomfortable cramps, keep waking up at night, my personalities change from good to bad, I have not been in a good mood since then. of course not, how can I be in a good mood when my vagina keeps bleeding on me every single day (I am sure no woman likes that), and so on. I spoke with my OB, and she said it's normal. I don't think so, it is completely not normal to me. I have been bleeding, and ruin my daily life style. No wonder it is called Birth Control. How can you have sex with your partner while you have all these symtomps in your body especially bleeding? I stop this drug, and can't wait to have my clean dates back.



Ladies: I am not saying all the women's body are the same. But if you want to be on this drug. I would advise you do more researches and read more comments before trying, and other advise is if you think it's a good idea for 4 periods per year, you may want to think twice. Because it's a mother nature for women that has 13 menstrual periods every year, trying to change it and playing with your hormones are the game, unless you like to gamble, then you may want to try this excitment drug, and hope you will win. Otherwise, please consider something else. I am so regret that I did not read all the comments and reviews before I asked my OB to put me on this drug. Therefore, I have to suffer what I deserve (I guess). I just don't want to see another woman to be suffered like me, as I finally found out there are lots of women out there are taking the same drug (before I made up my mind to throw this drug away) that are suffering the same symtomps but still want to continue and hopefully that will work one day. For me, ""no is no"". You can call me chicken or looser or whatsoever. But let me tell you, it is defintely not fun if the drug makes your life changes from okay to worse!

2985,strattera,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,add,"Greater focus, stronger commitment, lessened stress, improved self-confidence, goal setting, less depressed, better organization and memory (as in remembering events), clearer in thought and expression thereof.","Lower regard for self-value, naturally depressive concepts seem less far-fetched, appear less happy.","With or without this medication I am a philosopher. So I will be explain how the drug works on me from a philosophical assessment.



Background:

I had taken Strattera for three years (2005-2007) where it helped control ADD where I had difficulty doing so. It helped me focus, stay organized, manage relations, and most or all of the benefits I listed prior. I dropped the drug for 3 years so that I may learn how to control my ADD without the help of medication. During those three years I gained remarkable self control in overcoming ADD. However, I got to the point where I couldn't win over ADD, which was losing focus randomly. During college lectures that I found very intriguing I would often zone out/space out when I could not have been more interested in what was being professed. The frustration of this led me to conclude that medical assistance was the best choice.



On the drug:

I read and understand that the (generally) biggest con--side effect--to this drug is that there is some sort of depressive or suicidal figure involved. From an evaluative standpoint of myself, I've concluded that my desire for happiness is lowered from where it was prior to the drug. In other words, if I felt a need for a happiness at a 9th strength before, I now had the need for happiness at a 5th strength. Since happiness, to me and most I'd say, is the driving force for existence in life, a lessened desire for it would lead to two results. Lessened feeling for the needing to exist/live and feeling less depressed (because I now do not need to be happy as much as before).

I chose to discontinue the treatment.,Some mild stomach irritation.,"The knee pain became progressively more severe over the course of 2-3 months. My family doctor sent me to physical therapist who stress tested the knee, and the physical therapist determined that I should see the specialist.  A consultation with an orthopedic doctor was scheduled with an MRI performed.  The MRI showed some swelling in the knee joint ligaments under the front of the knee cap.  No tears or spurs were visible, thus the diagnosis was possible early stage of arthritis and/or minor injury.  I felt the arthritis was not completely impossible but more likely that some possible injury was probable owing to my daily work activity but no exact injury could be documented.  After the week of celebrex usage, without any noticable relief, I chose to discontinue the medication route in favor of some time off (2 weeks) with ice-pack heat-pad therapy to reduce swelling and pain. Next I self applied sparingly over time some physical therapy at the local gym, to strengthen any possible sprain-injury situation that may have occurred.

3036,seroquel,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,bipolar i,"The benefits were numerous, I don't have panic attcks for the first time in 20 yrs, and if I do, they are less than 20 seconds.  I haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  These symptoms continued to get more severe until I got on this drug.  Every episode was worse and lasted longer.  This drug gave me my life back.  I lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  But I have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  I have to admit, to get to the point I'm at now took 2 years, but it's better then I was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  The longer I'm on Seroquel, the better I feel.  Also, I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.  Seroquel doesn't make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  I also don't feel too tired in the morning.","There are side effects of course, as there are with any drug.  I have a little more stomach troubles than what I started with but that could be due to the Lithium.  I have also had about 20 pounds of weight gain.  Before the seroquel I was thin with a high metabolism.  My weight is steady now, but at 20 lbs higher than it used to be.  I tried losing the weight but it has been impossible to get it off.  The drug doesn't make me groggy but I know some people on it that it just knocks out.","I have been on and off lithium and paxil for years.  I tried zyprexa, depakote Triliptal and Lamictal, but these made meunfunctionally tired or I had severe reactions to them.  I have a problem where drugs create severe reactions and sensitivity in me so dr.s give small amounts of several rather than a mega dose of one.  I tried Risperdal but it gave me severe panic attacks and restlessness.  I started out with an antipsychotic and lithium at the hospital to bring the mania and mixed states down.  Later I switched to seroquel and Paxil was added to help with my anxiety and depression.  I was on Seroquel at a lower dose than most 200mg to start, 900mg lithium (anymore than that makes me very sick even though the blood tests show it's within normal limits)and Paxil at 25mg.  Now 2 years later, as I am not in a severe episode I can get by on half the Paxil, 50 mg Seroquel and the lowest Lithium possible to keep it in treatment range.  I raise the doses if I have to (with permission of the Nurse practitioner)and I take 25-50mg Seroquel as needed throughout the day if I need to for anxiety, although I don't need to very often.  The combination of seroquel, Paxil and lithium works best together for me.","['benefit', 'numerous', 'panic', 'first', 'time', '20', 'yr', 'le', '20', 'second', 'mixed', 'state', 'rapid', 'cycling', 'since', 'getting', '2', 'year', 'ago', 'symptom', 'continued', 'get', 'severe', 'got', 'drug', 'every', 'episode', 'wa', 'worse', 'lasted', 'longer', 'drug', 'gave', 'life', 'back', 'lost', 'job', 'wound', 'care', 'become', 'better', 'since', 'first', 'taking', 'drug', 'get', 'point', 'took', '2', 'year', 'better', 'wa', 'better', 'getting', 'better', 'longer', 'seroquel', 'better', 'feel', 'also', 'able', 'sleep', 'seroquel', 'worst', 'went', 'hospital', 'could', 'sleep', 'wa', 'making', 'episode', 'even', 'worse', 'sleeping', 'drug', 'benzodiazepine', 'valium', 'given', 'made', 'feel', 'horrible', 'tired', 'next', 'day', 'even', 'made', 'panic', 'even', 'psychotic', 'gave', 'panic', 'attack', 'made', 'made', 'tired', 'could', 'even', 'function', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'seroquel', 'doe', 'make', 'real', 'tired', 'ha', 'made', 'sleep', 'possible', 'also', 'feel', 'tired', 'morning']","['side', 'effect', 'course', 'drug', 'little', 'stomach', 'trouble', 'started', 'could', 'due', 'also', '20', 'pound', 'weight', 'gain', 'seroquel', 'wa', 'thin', 'high', 'metabolism', 'weight', '20', 'lb', 'higher', 'used', 'tried', 'losing', 'weight', 'ha', 'impossible', 'get', 'drug', 'doe', 'make', 'groggy', 'know', 'people']","['paxil', 'year', 'tried', 'zyprexa', 'depakote', 'lamictal', 'made', 'tired', 'severe', 'reaction', 'problem', 'drug', 'severe', 'reaction', 'sensitivity', 'dr', 'give', 'small', 'amount', 'several', 'rather', 'dose', 'one', 'tried', 'gave', 'severe', 'panic', 'attack', 'started', 'hospital', 'bring', 'mania', 'mixed', 'state', 'later', 'switched', 'seroquel', 'paxil', 'wa', 'added', 'help', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'wa', 'seroquel', 'lower', 'dose', '200mg', 'start', '900mg', 'anymore', 'make', 'sick', 'even', 'though', 'blood', 'test', 'show', 'within', 'normal', 'limit', 'paxil', '25mg', '2', 'year', 'later', 'severe', 'episode', 'get', 'half', 'paxil', '50', 'mg', 'seroquel', 'lowest', 'possible', 'keep', 'treatment', 'range', 'dos', 'nurse', 'practitioner', 'take', '25', '50mg', 'seroquel', 'needed', 'throughout', 'day', 'need', 'anxiety', 'although', 'need', 'often', 'combination', 'seroquel', 'paxil', 'work', 'best', 'together']"

2804,wellbutrin,5,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,depression,"I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  Finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, I got my head above water.  I was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water.","None of the previous meds I mentioned, however did a damn thing but cause me to shake, be continuously thirsty and not be able to achieve orgasm.  The wellbutrin was great in that it didn't cause any sexual side effects.  That was a relief.  The ability to reach orgasm seems as if it should me a basic right for every human being, and the emptiness that replaces the disappearance of the bodies biological ability to feel good, just doesn't seem right.  I was very adament in telling my psychiatrist that I didn't want anything that caused sexual side effects, which most anti-depressants do.  The cymbalta causes the ""emptiness""  but honestly, the improvement it has made in my mood and productivity make it worth it for now.  Plus, I'm not in a meaningfully intimate relationship at the moment.  It seems to only cause and inability to reach inner orgasm however.  Clitoral orgasm is still possible with vibrator and not a human being.

ACNE!!!!! I had a bit of anxiety when I first began taking it, but that has since gone away. My heart raced for a couple of weeks, but It's hard to tell if it really was the provigil simply because my heart often races at random. I had a bit of trouble sleeping the first 3 nights after taking provigil, but this hasn't been a problem AT ALL since. I have lost some weight that I had gained back just before starting provigil, and this has left my husband and therapist a little concerned, but I still get hungry and have not changed my diet...but the provigil IS the cause and I have no doubt about it. I did not refill it for three weeks earlier this year and gained nearly 10 pounds...so this drug would be fairly effective for weightloss.","My bipolar disorder is often at the lowest points more than the highest points anymore. In the past I switched moods much more rapidly and was given the diagnosis of Rapid cycling bipolar disorder. After my first daughter was born it only got worse. Weeks without any sleep! Then when my second daughter was born something changed within me. I couoldn't wake up at night to even hear her cry. My husband took vacation time to stay home to let me rest. I relapsed worse than ever with my eating disorder and required my 3rd feeding tube and I just could not function enough to even take care of myself, normal life or even my baby girls. I was go into fits of rage from the sheer exhaustion and would CLEAN FOR DAYS AND WEEKS without eating , drinking, sleeping or even sitting! Then I would crash! Finally my doctor decided to jusy try provigil, and it has helped a great deal along with cymbalta. I'm not sure why becasue according the everything I know about both medications...they are completely wrong for me. However, nothing else has worked thu far. I have taken EVERYTHING! This has been a dream for me even if I don't have as much pep in my step as I would like....I'm not a blank, lifeless, useless zombie.","['feel', 'much', 'awake', 'still', 'need', 'nap', 'everyday', 'even', 'taking', 'dos', '8', '10', 'hour', 'sleep', 'still', 'fatigued', 'able', 'think', 'clearly', 'even', 'drive', 'mood', 'much', 'better', 'seems', 'stable', 'fatigue', 'used', 'control', 'way', 'could', 'deal', 'wa', 'clean', 'like', 'crazy', 'put', 'focus', 'anything', 'real', 'issue', 'never', 'eating', 'drinking', 'anything', 'week', 'time', 'would', 'become', 'extremely', 'manic', 'focus', 'eating', 'disorder', 'ha', 'happened', 'since', 'taking', 'combination', 'cymbalta', 'read', 'medication', 'recommended', 'people', 'history', 'mania', 'ocd', 'eating', 'disorder', 'feel', 'effective', 'long', 'run']","['acne', 'acne', 'bit', 'anxiety', 'first', 'began', 'taking', 'ha', 'since', 'gone', 'away', 'heart', 'couple', 'week', 'hard', 'tell', 'really', 'wa', 'simply', 'heart', 'often', 'random', 'bit', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'first', '3', 'night', 'taking', 'ha', 'problem', 'since', 'lost', 'weight', 'gained', 'back', 'starting', 'ha', 'left', 'husband', 'little', 'concerned', 'still', 'get', 'hungry', 'changed', 'diet', 'refill', 'three', 'week', 'earlier', 'year', 'gained', 'nearly', '10', 'pound', 'drug', 'would', 'fairly', 'effective']","['bipolar', 'disorder', 'often', 'lowest', 'point', 'point', 'anymore', 'past', 'switched', 'mood', 'much', 'rapidly', 'wa', 'given', 'diagnosis', 'rapid', 'cycling', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'first', 'daughter', 'wa', 'born', 'got', 'worse', 'week', 'without', 'sleep', 'second', 'daughter', 'wa', 'born', 'something', 'changed', 'within', 'wake', 'night', 'even', 'hear', 'cry', 'husband', 'took', 'vacation', 'time', 'stay', 'home', 'let', 'rest', 'worse', 'ever', 'eating', 'disorder', 'required', '3rd', 'tube', 'could', 'function', 'enough', 'even', 'take', 'care', 'normal', 'life', 'even', 'baby', 'girl', 'wa', 'go', 'fit', 'rage', 'would', 'clean', 'day', 'week', 'without', 'eating', 'drinking', 'sleeping', 'even', 'sitting', 'would', 'crash', 'finally', 'doctor', 'decided', 'try', 'provigil', 'ha', 'helped', 'great', 'deal', 'along', 'cymbalta', 'sure', 'becasue', 'according', 'everything', 'know', 'medication', 'completely', 'wrong', 'however', 'nothing', 'else', 'ha', 'worked', 'far', 'taken', 'everything', 'ha', 'dream', 'even', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'zombie']"

Some days were still worse than others, but overall a dramatic difference. I could function throughout the day, wasn't almost falling asleep all the time. If work got crazy and I had to pull 14-16 hrs - which was quite frequent - I didn't get immediately sick.  I actually flew on planes multiple times without getting sick. I used to blink and get sick because my system was so run down despite many hours of sleep a night. When I take xyrem I need only 6-8 hours of sleep and I would wake up and feel great throughout the day. It was an absolute lifesaver for me.","I had a moderate number of side effects that were bothersome but not serious: Oily skin and hair, acne was worse in the beginning, excessive night time sweating - i would wake up drenched every night, acid reflux - this was on and off - tension and anxiety was increased during waking hours. I had teeth sensitivety that developed after starting the drug, rapid pulse (this was weird but it was never a bother), I lost a few lbs and I could eat whatever and not gain much weight. My testosterone levels went way high - not high enough to turn into a boy, but high enough to grow more body hair in places I didn't want and had some hair loss at the temples. I also had problems with short term memory, though I did before when I was in a fibro-fog too. So off the medicine I have a heck of a time still because it is back to fibro fog.  It is a shame because i used to have a great memory.","I would take 3 gms before bed. Wake up 2.50 to 4 hrs later for second dose.  It was easy to wake up, many times I would wake up on my own. Sometimes I would try to wake up too early and would just sleep through my alarm and then wake up closer to the 4 hr mark. If I didn't have a busy job it would just be ideal to try to get closer to 8 or more hrs of sleep every night. That was not always practical for me. I started off at the 3 gms dose twice per night and never had to change. Sometimes, depending on the time of month I got less sleep with the dose - i would awake after only 2.5 hrs later and get around 5 hrs of sleep a night.

2278,lexapro,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,clinical depression,The treatment benefits were very minimal because of the severe rage that I experienced. I don't think I benefited at all from taking this drug.,"This drug was very toxic to my system because it caused severe rage. I really was never relieved from my clinical depression because I kept hoping that the drug benefits would kick in and kept on taking it until one day I realized that I had to stop taking it. After about 2 months, I realized that I was very agitated constantly. I just thought that it would eventually go away but it never did. My nervousness was getting extreme. One day, I was in a grocery store shopping, pushing a grocery cart, and a little boy walked in front of me pushing a toy cart. I was so agitated that I had an INTENSE DESIRE to ram him with my shopping cart. I realized that this behavior was NOT ME and that the Lexapro was causing the severe rage. I also had a constant desire to start running down the street as fast as I could and NOT stop. I also couldn't sleep at night and if I was able to go to sleep finally, I would only stay asleep for a few hours. I sure hope this medication is taken off the market because it could cause some unstable patients to take other's lives from the severe rage.","This medication is manufactured by Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc. in St. Louis Missouri 63045. I was given the prescription of taking 10 mg. once a day. I cannot even imagine what would have happened to me if I had taken the full dosage recommended of 20 mg. I would have probably hurt someone badly. I have always suffered from clinical depression and have taken many different medications. Right now, Paxil is helping me with my depression a little. I think that I need to have it ""upped"" because the usual dosage isn't as effective as it once was. Anyway, my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro for me because he really believed that this new drug would be just perfect for me. I had no idea that it would cause such turmoil in my life. I was in a constant state of nervousness and my panic attacks had started to get much worse. I just thought that my daily routine was the cause for my anxiety but realized when I had the desire to shove my shopping cart into a little boy who walked in front of me in the store, as I stated before in this report, that I had to quit taking Lexapro. Sometimes, I would sit on my sofa at night and want so badly to just scream at the top of my lungs. My therapist just told me to take a pillow, put it over my face, and scream at the top of my lungs. I was afraid that my neighbors would call the police if they heard me. That was no way to live. This medication was so toxic to me that if I had not realized what it was doing to me, I might have even taken my own life. Because of my great faith in God, I didn't kill myself and finally realized that I had to call my doctor immediately the next morning to report what Lexapro was doing to me. I also have a friend who is taking Lexapro and has taken it for sometime. She also shows signs of rage at times. Just a minor infringement on her and she will go into a state of rage (but not as bad as I did). I have tried to tell her that she needs to get off Lexapro but she just thinks that OTHER people are intimidating her. One day, when she rams her car into someone elses because they pulled in front of her, she will finally realize that Lexapro is not the drug for HER either. I really do think that Lexapro should be taken off the market until further testing is done. I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone.

Had been perscribed many SSRI'S, due to depression but never fully treated for bi-polar because I felt like I deserved and did not want to give up the few highs I had when not depressed. I also did not believe I was bi-polar when dignosed 12 years ago as an in-patient, because I had no understanding of mixed episodes and rapid cycling. I thought when I was hypo-manic, it was just a great relief and celebration of not being depressed. I was also not honest about my alcohol abuse until about 6 months ago, and have since stopped drinking, which allowed me to realize I was quelling the manis with alcohol, and with out it I was more unstable and manic.

3431,tazorac,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"acne, photoaging","This is probably the best skin care product/medicine available. It is highly effective for both acne and photo-aging. It exfoliates the skin better than anything else, thus unclogging the pores. It also speeds up cell turnover, which reduces keratinization, preventing comedo-formation. It smooths out wrinkles, makes the deep layers of skin - dermis - thicker, increases collagen production, etc. You can read about all its benefits on PubMed. It has been proven more effective than tretinoin (Retin A) for both acne and photoaging.","Initially it is quite irritating, that is why it is VERY important to start using it less often and with a smaller applied amount. Do not overdose on Tazorac or else your skin - the upper horny layer, statum corneum - will become so thin and dry that it will crack - thus you will actually CREATE wrinkles rather than eliminate any. If you take it slowly and gradually increase the dose, you won't have that problem, as the skin adjusts to it. You should probably start using it only every 3rd or 4th day initially, gradually increasing to every other day or even every day. Some people are able to use it twice a day; I know I cant. In case you develop severe irritation, you must use a good moisturizer to prevent wrinkle formation. If you are using it for acne, and are using other products such as benzoyl peroxide - as you should, you should be even more careful, as skin irritation is cumulative from the various drugs. You will have to use a lower dose BP such as 2.5% because your skin will be exfoliated and more easily irritated.","The gel is more effective than the cream, in that it delivers a higher dosage of the medication faster. The cream however has lower side effects and it achieves more controlled release of the drug. I believe the cream is more appropriate for anti-aging, as it is more emollient. Neither the cream nor the gel are comedogenic so acne sufferers should not worry. I have used both the gel and the cream, with both concentrations - .05% and .1%. I am currently using the .1% cream.

2851,albuterol,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,asthma,Opened lungs when breathing was difficult.,Stimulating--very.,"I used an asthma inhaler frequently as a child.  I think it was albuterol, although it is hard to be certain.



In my forties, I had a recurrence of asthma.  The pharmacist and my doctor both said NOT to use the over-the-counter inhalers.  I did try one, and it was MUCH more heart-poundingly stimulating than albuterol.  Dangerous for someone with heart problems, but difficulty breathing would be dangerous as well.



At some point, I got a generic albuterol inhaler and found it much less effective than the Ventolin brand.  My doctor said that other patients had told her the same thing.



I rarely need it now, maybe only once every two years.  But I try to keep one with me at all times because when I need it, I really need it.  I take long walks down and up a hill and if I had an attack at the bottom of the hill I would be in trouble.



It is almost magic, though--one minute it takes a great exertion to breathe and I feel like I am suffocating--then I inhale Ventolin and my bronchial tubes open right up.  It is a lifesaver.



As a child and teenager I did not mind the slight ""rush,""  I even liked it.  Part of that rush may be caused by the deep exhalation and inhalation required to properly ingest the drug.","['opened', 'lung', 'breathing', 'wa', 'difficult']",[],"['used', 'asthma', 'inhaler', 'frequently', 'child', 'think', 'wa', 'albuterol', 'although', 'hard', 'certain', 'asthma', 'pharmacist', 'doctor', 'said', 'use', 'counter', 'inhaler', 'try', 'one', 'wa', 'much', 'heart', 'albuterol', 'dangerous', 'someone', 'heart', 'problem', 'difficulty', 'breathing', 'would', 'dangerous', 'well', 'point', 'got', 'generic', 'albuterol', 'inhaler', 'found', 'much', 'le', 'effective', 'ventolin', 'brand', 'doctor', 'said', 'patient', 'told', 'thing', 'rarely', 'need', 'maybe', 'every', 'two', 'year', 'try', 'keep', 'one', 'time', 'need', 'really', 'need', 'take', 'long', 'walk', 'attack', 'bottom', 'would', 'trouble', 'almost', 'though', 'one', 'minute', 'take', 'great', 'breathe', 'feel', 'like', 'inhale', 'ventolin', 'bronchial', 'tube', 'open', 'right', 'lifesaver', 'child', 'mind', 'slight', 'even', 'part', 'may', 'caused', 'deep', 'required', 'properly', 'drug']"

719,accutane,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,acne,"Although it's a very powerful/dangerous drug if used while pregnant, or not monitored by your doctor, Accutane really helped my skin. I have tried EVERYTHING! THe benefits were it got rid of all my acne, it shrunk my pores, made my skin less oily, and my hair, smoother skin, brighter skin, even toned. On Accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for 3-4 days. Normally I had to wash my hair everyday because it was so greasy. I would never go without a day of washing when I wasn't on Accutane.","Some of my side effects were really dry lips, sensitive eyes,burning sensation on my face, sensitive skin (if I scratched my hand for example it woulds be sensitive and would scar easily. This time around i had less side effects. The first time on Accutane (10 years ago when I was 16 yrs old) I had bad side effects. I was taking too high of a dose in my opinion 80mg/day. I weighed 100-110 lbs. I had scabbed skin, dry eyes, stomach pain, slight depression, achy body, back pain, joint pain...","FIrst treatment at 16 years old. 2 pills a day of 40mg. With food.  At 26 years old and 105 lbs I took only 1 pill a day that was 40mg. Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked.

2. Burning;

3. Red spots;

4. Pigment spots look darker.

5. Skin is very sensitive. I can't put a Sunscreen on at all.

6. Possibility to develop skin cancer!

7. Bad experience for $200!!!","Hi! I am a russian (european race) who has migrated from Sweden to the USA. I have developed melasma (dark spots) under my eyes and on my forehead. I visited a dermatologist in the USA, FL about 1 month ago. He prescribed me Tri Luma that contains 4% of Hudroquinone. Have you ever read about Hydroquinone?- I asked him. As I investigated it I found the information that hydroquinone has been banned in many european countries including France, Sweden and Russia etc, for concerns about increased cancer risk.The FDA admitted that the risk of using the drug is not known and more testing needs to be done.In fact, the FDA also warned that hydroquinone has been linked to a condition that disfigures the skin. Anyway,I tried the cream, a sample that the doctor gave to me. He prescribed to use it twice a week - Mondays and Fridays. It was terrible!!! I used it just once a week on my pigment spots because my skin got red, burning and after 1 week it was peeling. Some doctors prescribe to use it once, twice a day!!! I put it on only once a week. Ok, after 1 month, 4 treatments I have the result: my pigment spots have not been improved at all. Moreover, the skin is burnt and now I have very obvious dark red-brown spots. I really look terrible. I can't put on any sunscreen because the skin is damaged by Tri Luma. I am so happy that I didn't buy the full size cream which costs $200 and the insurance doesn't cover it.

1092,effexor,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,depression,"The effexor worked the first day I took it.  For some time previously, I had felt ""paralyzed,"" or too depressed to get much done.  The day I began taking it, I noticed a difference in that I felt more able to get out of the house, and able to cope with the difficulties of mothering 6 children full-time. As I said, it worked the first day, but continued to work better and better over the next 3 weeks until I worked up to my eventual dose (I started at 37 mg. and worked my way up to 300 mg.).","The only side effect I noticed was that if, for some reason, I forgot to take the effexor in the morning, by the evening I felt sort of dizzy in a really weird way.","I'm not clear on what is wanted in this section.  I will do my best, and if you wish to email me with a request for specific info, I will be happy to help.  I was seeing a psychiatrist 9 years ago who thought Effexor was worth a try.  I had been on Prozac a few yrs previous, and although it worked really well, after taking it for two years I developed the side effect of experiencing arthritic pain in my hands.  That was the reason I discontinued the use of Prozac. After being off the Prozac or any other meds for a year or two, I could feel myself sliding back into the black hole of depression and severe anxiety.  I found a doctor (psychiatrist)and he put me on Effexor.  It was a miracle.  I was soooo happy to find something that worked so well, and on the first try. (Several years before, I had gone through what my family refers to as the ""year of hell,"" when I first began the journey of searching for an anti-depressant that would work AND not have side effects that kept me from functioning normally.) My treatment consisted of: Taking the 300 mg of effexor, and monthly visits to my psychiatrist to determine how well my effexor was working and to discuss other treatment options. Although I could notice a marked difference in my mood, I still felt that I wasn't nearly as healthy mentally as I needed to be.  I would still have days when I felt ""paralyzed"" and very anxious.  When I discussed the problem with my psych., he suggested that I add Luvox, another anti-depressant, to my regimen.  That helped as well, although there were two unpleasant side effects: 1) loss of sex drive and difficulty achieving orgasm, and 2) night sweats.  My doc prescribed 1 mg of hytrin for the night sweats; it worked, and he recommended 60 mg. ginko biloba daily for the loss of sex drive.  It may have helped a little, but I was never quite sure. One other thing I found beneficial for my anxiety was 10 mg. dexadrine.  It seemed contradictory to me that a stimulant would calm me down, but the very first day I took it, I felt calm for the first time in my life. Up until then I didn't realize how severe my anxiety was, because I had never known what it was like to be without it. But that very first day I took it, I felt a calmness come over me that was such a relief.  Always before, I had a feeling inside that I can only explain as the feeling one would get if one was late for an important meeting with one's boss.  Sort of like, ""I'm late! Gotta hurry! oh, no!""  That was a feeling that I had always had, and it had nothing to do with what my situation was-- late or early, it made no difference.  For the first two weeks I took the Dexadrine, I didn't pull my hair (trichotillomania)at all, nor did I even realize I wasn't pulling, as I didn't even think about it.  Unfortunately, I did go back to pulling after that. The 2 side effects I experienced with the dex. is that 1) it made me drowsy for about the first hour after I took it, and 2) it made me feel like I lost my spontaneity.  I got a lot more done, and I didn't feel so panicked, but I wasn't as much fun.  For that reason, I stopped taking it regularly and took it maybe only half of the time.  After maybe a year or two I quit taking it altogether and when I went back on it last year after having been off of it for about 5 years, it no longer worked as it had before.  It made me feel jittery as though I'd had way too much coffee.  It just made the anxiety worse.

1697,retin-a-micro,10,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,sun damage to face,"The prescription recommended that I use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  I alternate one night of Retin-A, 1 night of Stri-Vectin.  The Retin-A causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that I don't look as if my face has dandruff.  I use a Clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  I have also used Benefit's ""Bluff Dust"" to cover the redness that the Retin-A gel causes, and continue to use Noritate for my rosacea.  The Retin-A is very effective, but also quite expensive.  I have found a pharmacy in Canada where I can order it online for less than 50% the US price.  I hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  I have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because I am a committed scowler.  I do not believe that Retin-A would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience.","Some of the information in this and the following paragraph will be redundant because when I started writing a response to the first question, I didn't see what was to follow.  The Retin-A gel dried my skin and caused it to peel.  For this reason, I used it every other day instead of every day. I alternate with Stri-Vectin.  I also need to exfoliate frequently or my face looks frightening!

When exfoliated and moisturized, my skin looks wonderful.  I have used Benefit Cosmetics' ""Bluff Puff"" to tone down the redness; I have stopped using any kind of makeup base if my face is shedding because foundation doesn't tolerate pieces of peeling skin very well.  However, my complexion looks great without makeup.  I still use mascara and liner and shadow.","Before going to bed, I wash my face with the Clarisonic brush.  I love it!

When my face is clean and dry, I apply a pea-sized amount of Retin-A gel all over my face and neck.  I do not avoid the eye area, but I do wash the gel off my eyebrows with a q-tip and water so that the skin under my eyebrows doesn't peel.  I also put Talika Lipocils on my eyelashes.  

In the morning I wash my face, exfoliating every couple of days to rid the skin surface of drying flakes.  Then I moisturize with shea butter or almond oil or even extra-virgin olive oil.  This does not make my face oily; my skin drinks up the oil and looks good.

The patient started having delusions as well as other bizarre behavior and the family could not convince the patient otherwise.  The patient was also on renexa which is known to be a strong inhibitor and I believe caused the seroquel to attain toxic blood levels.  The family tried to contact the psychiatrist to discuss the problems but before this occurred, the patient went into v-fib miles from a hospital.  It was more than 20 minutes before the life saving crew arrived at the scene and even longer before the patient arrived to the ER for treatment.  The patient was pronounced dead on the scene.","The patient was referred to the psychiatrist by his cardiologist secondary to depression and increasing insomnia.  The patient had been on welbutrin for years for depression and smoking cessation.  The psychiatrist kept the patient on welbutrin and added xanax for anxiety and seroquel for sleep at bedtime.  Slowly the family started noticing strange behavior, delusions, and almost dementia type characteristics in the patient that occured over a 4 month period and began to get more severe.  The family attempted to talk about the changes with the patient but as true delusional behavior dictates, the patient was unable to see any of the changes.  The forgetfulness, clumsiness, and personality changes such as irritability increased.  The family attempted to contact the psychiatrist but in interim, the patient died of a cardiac arrest.  Even after talking to the psychiatrist after the patient's death, the psychiatrist denied that seroquel had any affect on the situation.  The family and myself as the primary caretaker believe that seroquel was directly responsible for the patient's death.

But, after only 4 days at the lower 150mg dosage, the excessive sleepiness after 8h of normal sleep continued, so I need to try cutting down the dosage even more.

I was constantly anxious and scared and the rivotril made it possible for me to come down to relatively normal anxiety levels in ""safe"" situations, whereas before I didn't have any situations I considered safe.  It helped me sleep and made me feel more rested and in control.  I got pregnant while taking it (I had been trying for 18 years) and I honestly believe that being more relaxed helped me not only to get pregnant but to carry the baby as I had had four miscarraiges previously.  I started confronting situations that were uncomfortable to me before and was able to live a reasonably normal life, even though I have become housebound.  I feel the rivotril got me through a very tough time in my life.","The Rivotril didn't have any side effects in the long run, it made me a bit sluggish at first.  However after taking it for a few years and feeling I no longer needed it, I found it impossible to stop taking it as the withdrawal symptoms were so bad.  I have cut the dosage down considerably, from 5 mg at night to one, then I became nervous again and started taking 2 again.  I have tried several times to come off the drug completely but the results have been tremors and feeling sick along with high anxiety to the point of hardly being able to speak.  I would always go back on it.  I never felt I needed MORE...I just coudn't stop taking even a small amount.","I was told that panic attacks were caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain in the same area that caused epileptic fits.  As Rivotril is a sedative and is given to people with epilepsy they had found that it also helped alleviate panic attacks.  I was prescribed it for this reason.  I am unable to take anti-depressants which also stop panic attacks because of strong side effects so this was a better choice for me at the time.



I feel that it did the job, but had I known I would be on it for the rest of my life I'm not sure I would have started taking it.  But maybe if I was desperate like I was then I would.  I was concerned about taking it while pregnant but my child was normal.  She did have bad withdrawal symptoms though after I stopped breast feeding her.  No one realized that was what was happening when she cried all the time for seemingly no reason.  Back then it was unknown that going off the drug caused withdrawal as the drug had never been used short term.  Only for epileptics for life.  She is 13 now and perfectly normal.

2722,elavil,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,chronic headaches,"Since I was very young, a child, I suffered debilatating headaches.  Often they became true migraines.  They would last for days and days, sometimes weeks

without stop.  I missed school, parties, holidays.  I was scared to make plans

to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to

live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some

prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered

headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide

open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil

and within days her headaches subsided.  I went straight to my pain management

physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days

without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked

forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have

probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When

I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without

He told me I caught a sinus infection since the steroid lowers your emmmune system and makes it easier to catch another infection. He then prescribed me to 50 mg of Prednisone each day for a 3 day term so that it could tackle the inflammation fast so that the cortisone puffer would be able to catch up ( it couldn't work fast enough as it takes a while to start working) and also prescribed me to Amoxicillin for the sinus infection (since it was caused by bacteria) He said he would have prescribed me the antibiotic even if i didn't catch the sinus infection as an immune booster since prednisone lowers your immune system..

It somewhat lightened my freckles and age spots pretty quickly (within a couple of weeks) but after that stopped helping. I also had a brown patchy area on my leg that has been around forever. I used it as my ""test"" patch to monitor progress. Just like my face it lightened the spot pretty quickly and then stopped working. The spot since then has remained lighter but has never gone away altogether. 

I would say I saw a 25% improvement in the sun spots on my face.  I have a lot of them so overall it didn't really make a difference in how my skin looks. 

I did not have much irritation when I started using this product but I had been using Retin A before I started the Tri Luma so maybe my skin was used to it already. I did notice that it stung the skin around my eyes when I used it on the brown spots high up on my cheekbones.

Also, was told it would help reduce acne and breakouts.  It did not which is disappointing.

If I knew these drugs do cause hair loss it might affect its rating,... but then again it does save the eyes.",I had elevated occular pressure that needed to be reduced and my doctor put me on xalatan which caused my eyelashes to begin to thicken and become dark in a couple of months so I had him put me on something else so we went to cosopt. After a time I felt like this was causing increased hair loss so I looked up drug side effects and cosopt was listed as causing hair loss so I had him change it again then I started alphagan p and azopt. My eyes after nearly two months time turned red and never cleared up so the doctor dropped the alphagan p and replaced it with timilol 0.25 percent. The redness quickly went away.

to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to

live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some

prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered

headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide

open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil

and within days her headaches subsided.  I went straight to my pain management

physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days

without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked

forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have

probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When

I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without

additional meds.  Needless to say my entire life changed. I am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  I take the generic and notice no difference from

My memory vanished (I affectionately nicknamed this drug ""stupimax"" and ""Dopamax""), I got strange aches and pains in my bones, joints, and muscles. I was more sensitive to the sun and heat and my sweat was reduced. I frequently had a runny nose and cough. Food tasted funny. Sex felt different (not bad- just different) my skin was  very sensitive to touch and my hearing was overactive. My potassium kept testing deficient and I had to be prescribed supplements. My hair also fell out in clumps!



All that went away or got better with some time. I also found out WHY it was happening- I was malnourished. Once I started drinking 56-80oz of water a day, taking a multivitamin + biotin (for the hair issue!), eating potassium rich foods and a more healthy diet all of a sudden the side effects started to vanish.

""Shared Solutions"", the company behind Copaxone provides you with everything you need for each injection, including; in home injection training, which I was able to get down with just one session, but they will come as often as you need.



You load an injection tool with a syringe.  Remove the cap from the syringe (simple).  Wipe the inection site with a kind of cheap, provided alcohol wipe.  Let the alcohol dry (30-60) seconds.  Place the tip of the tool on the injection site, press a button and the tool injects the shot in about 7-15 seconds.  It varies.  Yeah, I called them cheap alcohol wipes, but they are good enough and I'm picky.  I buy my own because they are inexpensive.



Most important as stated earlier by ""49 year old female"" rotate the injection sites.  Rotate, Rotate, Rotate.  No tissue damage for me so far from Copaxone, but minor damage from Avonex on leg.  Rotate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2065,warfarin,6,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,heart condition,"Taking 3 mg of warfarin sufficiently thinned my blood so that I did not find it difficult to do everyday tasks.  I immediately felt better after I started the regimen in the spring of 2003.  My cough went away and I had a lot more energy.

I took this regimen for about 3 years, everyday.  I also found it easier to concentrate and think (what was I doing before it???)  It was as if my brain cleared up or something.  I breathed easier and I was more willing to tackle regular household chores.  I worked over 50 hours/week before and during this treatment.","The side effects of warfarin on me did not become apparent until a couple of years later.  I started feeling weak and I bruised easily.  I acquired more broken blood vessels/capillaries veins in my feet and calves.  I was tired and started feeling cranky.  I stopped taking warfarin for 6 months but then went back to it after I had the old feeling of ""thick"" blood.  During the 6 months that I wasn't taking warfarin, I felt better, had more energy.  But then the downside: my blood was getting too thick and I was starting to get headaches.  So I went back on it.  This time my doctor said I might have to increase dosage to 4 mg. since I hadn't been taking the warfarin.  However, when I had my thrombin checked, I was okay at 3 mg.; I took this for another 3 months and then started feeling the old way and quit again.  The same scenario was repeated (started feeling like I had ""thick"" blood and now I had increasingly bad headaches).  I went back on 3 mg. of warfarin in August of this year but only took them for 3 months. Then I started a vitamin/mineral/COQ10 regimen and stuck with it and am still doing that.  I credit most of the perfect blood feeling (for lack of a better term) to Vitamin E and the fact that I also changed my diet.  I try to eat a lot of veggies and fruits, and I have been a vegetarian for almost two years (not super strict - but I feel disgusted about eating meat and therefore never eat it unless it is buried in some food.  I do eat salmon and tuna.  The final straw for me with warfarin was that I started feeling really mad about things.  The littlest things would make me angry, anger that was way out of proportion to the incident.   When my teenaged daughter started crying after I ripped into her for staying longer at a social visit, and I heard my words echoing in my house, I knew that was it.  I quit warfarin and started taking 81 mg. of aspirin daily (I had a headache every morning after I went off warfarin).  I started the vit./min. regimen in November, gradually adding supplements as I learned about their benefits, but it wasn't until 3-4 weeks ago that I realized I wasn't having any headaches and I was able to stop taking 81 mg. of aspirin. Also, since starting the stricter diet and the vit./min. supplements (also some herbs), I have not had an anger ""fit"" (of course, I am also more prone to control my anger because I really didn't like how I had been), I do not feel depressed.  I have told everyone in my family about this because it seems so remarkable.  Why didn't the doctors tell me?","Treatment consisted of simply taking 3 mg. of warfarin daily and getting my blood thrombin checked every two months.  I was not a very good patient about getting my blood thr. checked so I'm sure when I was feeling weak and bruised/bled so easily, my blood was getting too thin.  And then when I would quit the warfarin for several weeks, sometimes months at a time, my blood would get too thick.  I really like my doctor though, because he tells me to do what makes me feel best, and I think that's smart advice.  I must say add that I always loved the feeling of donating blood before I took warfarin because it gave me the same feeling as I initially had with warfarin (at the very beginning of my treatment).  I would like to donate blood now but they don't let me because I don't weigh enough (which makes no sense at all).  Couldn't they take less blood?

Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor ""cure"" so I delayed, hoping I would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it, but when I stopped, there was no ""cure"" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience, but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and I focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. Those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the samE comes in. It makes the difference.","As indicated in the question relating to treatment benefits; the side effects of Effexor, for me, were a tendency to sleep a lot, and to feel sleepy much of the time.","I began Effexor under the care of a psychiatrist who was treating me for depression. My depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and I had begun to ""shut down"" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. When I had to run errands, like grocery shopping, I felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment. My treatment with Effexor, at worst, sometimes simply took me down (energy-wise) an additional notch from where I was. At best, it shifted me from the uncomfortable detached feeling and elevated my mood a couple of notches above where it had been. I had moments of feeling fully functional. That was enough to give me a sense of feeling better, and the will to decide to take my full energy back. That's when I stopped taking it, and experienced the miraculous ""cure"". If I ever experience such a deep depression again, I will choose to try the Effexor again (the original, not the newer version), rather than the Cymbalta. With the Cymbalta, I would already know that the benefits would only last as long as I chose to be on it, whereas, the Effexor would give me hope for a lengthy remission.","['taken', 'various', 'anti', 'depressant', 'year', 'wa', 'ever', 'came', 'cure', 'wa', 'stopped', 'taking', 'medication', 'cure', 'took', 'place', 'never', 'experienced', 'anti', 'depressant', 'taking', 'effexor', 'made', 'sleepy', 'time', 'slept', 'good', 'deal', 'normal', '10', '12', 'hour', 'daily', 'stopped', 'taking', 'felt', 'better', 'year', 'remained', 'depression', 'free', '3', 'year', 'depression', '8', '10', 'month', 'want', 'lose', 'another', '6', '8', 'week', 'taking', 'effexor', 'cure', 'hoping', 'would', 'finally', 'wa', 'going', 'happen', 'returned', 'doctor', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'tried', 'cymbalta', 'hoping', 'get', 'effexor', 'benefit', 'without', 'side', 'effect', 'worked', 'well', 'long', 'used', 'stopped', 'wa', 'cure', 'like', 'would', 'effexor', 'take', 'mg', 'good', 'post', 'effexor', 'experience', 'feel', 'le', 'medical', 'system', 'maintenance', 'focus', 'physical', 'health', 'good', 'food', 'exercise', 'maintain', 'emotional', 'health', 'thing', 'alone', 'unfortunately', 'completely', 'come', 'make', 'difference']","['indicated', 'treatment', 'benefit', 'side', 'effect', 'effexor', 'tendency', 'sleep', 'lot', 'feel', 'sleepy', 'much', 'time']","['began', 'effexor', 'care', 'psychiatrist', 'wa', 'treating', 'depression', 'depression', 'took', 'form', 'lack', 'interest', 'life', 'begun', 'degree', 'sometimes', 'act', 'walking', 'house', 'required', 'strong', 'act', 'run', 'like', 'felt', 'uncomfortable', 'environment', 'treatment', 'effexor', 'worst', 'sometimes', 'simply', 'took', 'energy', 'additional', 'wa', 'best', 'uncomfortable', 'feeling', 'elevated', 'mood', 'couple', 'moment', 'feeling', 'fully', 'functional', 'wa', 'enough', 'give', 'sense', 'feeling', 'better', 'decide', 'take', 'full', 'energy', 'back', 'stopped', 'taking', 'experienced', 'cure', 'ever', 'experience', 'deep', 'depression', 'choose', 'try', 'effexor', 'original', 'newer', 'version', 'rather', 'cymbalta', 'cymbalta', 'would', 'already', 'know', 'benefit', 'would', 'last', 'long', 'chose', 'whereas', 'effexor', 'would', 'give', 'hope', 'remission']"

Before the earthquake, I was already experiencing depressive symptoms but was reluctant to take medication for it.

About two weeks later, I found myself feeling good again, (in spite of my therapist telling me how screwed up my family was) driving down the freeway, singing at the top of my lungs and playing air drums on the steering wheel of my car. The ""Old me"" was back! 



Thanks to the medication, I was able to re-organize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them.","The sexual side effects ultimately led me stop taking the Zoloft. My husband and I found it very frustrating that I was unable to reach climax where before, I had been multi-orgasmic. Because our sex life is very important to us, this became an area of contention that I found to be unacceptable.  My inability to reach orgasm was demoralizing for my husband feeling he could no longer please me and for me the frustration of it all made sex seem like too much work to bother with. My libido came to a screeching halt. This depressed both of us so I gradually weaned myself off the Zoloft and shortly thereafter, became pregnant with our first child. 



One other thing about taking the Zoloft was that after the elevated mood from the initial breakthrough of depression wore off; I found myself living life somewhere in the middle. In addition to the lows no longer being depressingly low, the highs were not as uplifting as before. I was, in essence, comfortably numb.



Other side effects were dry mouth, nausea, weight gain, and increased irritability. , although the later could have been due to the stress of our temporary living conditions.","My primary care physician prescribed counseling and the antidepressant, Zoloft. The plan was to take the medication for three to six months until I felt I was back on track and could maintain a functional lifestyle without it. 



I started with 25 mg every other day for five days, then 25 mg a day for one week, followed by 50 mg a day every day thereafter. I began therapy with a psychologist once a week where I was diagnosed with PTSD.

1685,claritin,9,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,indoor allergies,"I recently saw my PCP for my annual exam and had 2 major concerns to discuss with her.  The first was some depression issues and the second was that I had recently developed indoor allergies.  As is standard my PCP recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and Claritin (24hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  The problem is that I am nursing my son and no antidepressants are ""safe"" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  On the other hand, my MD approved Claritin although I was nursing.  At the end of the session she told to to start on Claritin and come back for the antidepressants once I weened my son.  So I started the Claritin and my depression abated.  All of my ""depressive"" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  Since I started taking Claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  I feel ""normal"" for the first time in a long time.  In terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.  Regardless, I am happy with the product.



I share this in the hope that some scientist out there uses this information to help our elusive understanding of depression and its treatment.  Perhaps an alternative for postpartum depression?

I used to sleep 12-16 hours per day and was always tired and fatigued when awake.  I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 5 years ago, but even sleeping with CPAP did not help with my daytime fatigue.  After seeing MANY family practitioners, I finally broke down and INVESTED in a very well educated Psychiatrist who diagnoed me with ADD since childhood.  His decision to prescribe Vyvanse was brilliant!  I feel better than ever and am totally clear headed and able to consentrate.  For the first time in as long as I can remember, I can think normally!  No more racing thoughts in my head, and my depression and anxiety has all but vanashed!  I do still take an antidepressive, but I am CERTAIN that the Vyvanse gave the antidepression meds the ability to work.  I can FINALLY sleep a normal 7 to 9 hours and still be awake and alert throughout my 12-hour work days.  I was worried that the Vyvanse would elevate my anxiety level, but the opposite occured!  My anxiety is all but absent, and I no longer have the need to continue with my anti-anxiety meds!  There is NO SUBSTITUTE for a Doctor who is a specialist in mental health.  Spend the money and see!  A good Psychiatrist will spend HOURS with you before making a diagnosis, and if Adult ADD is what you have, then give Vyvanse a try.  It worked GREAT for me and my live has turned around for the better.  It is the best remedy that I have found in 15 years!

3061,oxycodone,3,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,pain management,"Initially the treatment benefits were

-increased mobility/ activity level due to experiencing less pain

- sleep ( was able to sleep longer while the medication was still active)

- better mood (because of less pain)","The level of pain control quickly decreased (with the prescribed amount of medication(10 mg)) resulting in having to steadily increase the dosage for the same amount of pain relief. However the worst side effects were severe constipation(even while taking stool softeners/extra fiber, water, etc), depression, insomnia, weight loss, hair loss, muscle wasting, my skin became completely dehydrated and wrinkled. Became physically and mentally addicted to the medication, when I tried to reduce the dosage /stop taking the medication I experienced severe withdrawal symptoms (fever,chills, nausea, vomiting, severe bone muscle and joint pain) to name a few.","I was in an MVA in 2002 in which I suffered a whiplash type injury which caused/accelerated the DDD. I was prescribed Percocette 5mg on an as needed basis for pain control. After 3 years (of constant agonizing pain)of being on the Percocette they became ineffective at relieving pain and I was referred to a PAIN CLINIC specializing in chronic pain. The doctors there decided that I had built up a tolerance/dependence on the Percocette and that it would be best to put me on a longer acting narcotic (Oxycontin 10mg,time released, supposed to provide pain relief for 12 hrs) with Percocette (Oxycodone 5mg/Acetaminophen 325 mg)for break through pain. In the beginning the medication seemed to help but over time I built up a tolerance to the Oxycodone(they became less effective) which meant I had to keep increasing the dosage to get the same amount of pain relief. For example I started out with Oxycontin 10mg/3x day and approx 3 Percocette/daily a couple of months later as my tolerance increased I had to take Oxycontin 20mg/3X day and 5-6 Percocette as the months passed by my tolerance grew and my dosage was increased. After about 8 months on the Oxycontin I started to experience all of the side effects mentioned above, not only did I notice the negative effects the drug was having on me but friends and family noticed too, and mentioned (not to me but amongst themselves) that my appearance/demeanor over the past 2 yrs had dramatically changed. A couple of months ago my Sister took me aside and asked me what was wrong to which I replied nothing why? She then explained to me how my behavior(depression, moodiness, etc.) and appearance(drastic weight loss) had been getting worse and worse and told me that she was worried. Being under the influence of these drugs for so long I felt like I was in a fog and really had no idea as to the extent of how bad it really was/ how I looked. So I stepped back and examined the last 4-5 yrs of my life while on these medications and realized that they had taken a considerable toll on me emotionally, physically, mentally. I strongly advise that before anyone decides to go this route for pain management that you have a long talk with your Physician on the pros and cons of this medication specifically the Oxycontin. If I would have known then what I know now about all the negative side effects I would never, never had started taking it. I feel that it deteriorated my body (especially my muscle mass and skin). When I started taking the medication I was 37 and felt 25 and was told I looked like I was in my late 20's, I am now 42, I feel 50 and now in an effort to spare my feelings people don't mention anything about how old I look . I wish that my Physicians would have told me about ALL of the negative effects of this medication instead of just the positive (which are few). In my opinion the negative far outweigh the positive. I'm still in constant pain but will continue to search for pain management without drugs.

Then, after about 15 days, I began to feel different. My constant sense of fear and worry was replaced by a sudden feeling of self-confidence. My depression, which formerly kept me in a state of perpetual sorrow, self-pity and doubt, was lifted from me like a veil. Suddenly I was talkative and social, where before I was soft-spoken and hesitant. I behaved as if I could not fail in anything I undertook to do. I was asking women on dates with a directness and boldness that almost scared women away. You could say that while I was taking Paxil I was in a hypermanic state. The benefits were very real. I loved the miraculous effects of this medication. Unfortunately I was forced to stop taking Paxil because of negative side effects.","Decreased libido, insomnia, dry mouth, increased appetite","I was not able to have sex because Paxil left me sexually numb. It was difficult to maintain an erection. When I did get an erection it was without any sexual pleasure, in other words, it was just a mechanical erection.

I could not sleep no matter how tired I became during the day. I had constant energy that would not go away even when I wanted to sleep. The insomnia was so bad that even sleeping pills could not counteract Paxil.

Dry mouth was mild to moderate, but nonetheless bothersome.

I gained a tremendous amount of weight in a short time. I went from 171lbs. to 227lbs. in about 4 months. Paxil gave me a huge appetite.

I intend to try gabapentin now, although some people have referred to it as the 'zombie drug'.

After fifteen years and several changes of dermatologists, I got a new doctor and asked if the metronidazole could be causing enlarged pores.

Neck Pain","I have been taking minocycline 100mg twice a day. At first I had no side effects what so ever. However after a week I started heaving headaches and they gradually got worse. It was when I started having neck pains, I stopped using Minocycline. Although I stopped using it, I never thought the pains were due to it - I thought it was from going out right after the shower which I often do. That same night I woke up with hives appearing in my body and towards the end of the day, my face got swollen (eyes and my inner lip.) At first I thought it was a food allergy, went to the doctor and got a full blood test (White blood cells, red cells, cholesterol, sugar, full allergy, almost everything.)



During the waiting period of my results (took about a week and a half) I was taking steroid pills for allergies and I got back to normal within 5 days. On the 8th day, I was like hmm lets take minocycline again, I wanna be proactive and not break out on acne again. I took one pill at night after 8 days of not using it, and the next day I got itchy hands and a few hives and then I realized it was the minocycline that I was reacting to. Luckily I only took one pill and over the counter allergy medicine such as zyrtec got rid off my itchiness and I am back to normal again.







So around 8-9 days later after I gave blood, the results came to my doctor. To my surprise everything came normal no allergies what so ever, no pollen, no nuts, no nuts, no dust completely NO ALLERGIES. My Red Blood cell count along with hematocrit came a little high but nothing else.



I am almost confident to say that minocycline was what I was reacting to and my doctor told me to stop taking it.","['decreased', 'number', 'acne', 'lesion']","['major', 'headache', 'neck', 'pain']","['taking', 'minocycline', '100mg', 'twice', 'day', 'first', 'side', 'effect', 'ever', 'however', 'week', 'started', 'headache', 'gradually', 'got', 'worse', 'wa', 'started', 'neck', 'pain', 'stopped', 'using', 'minocycline', 'although', 'stopped', 'using', 'never', 'thought', 'pain', 'due', 'thought', 'wa', 'going', 'right', 'often', 'night', 'woke', 'hive', 'body', 'towards', 'end', 'day', 'face', 'got', 'swollen', 'eye', 'inner', 'lip', 'first', 'thought', 'wa', 'food', 'allergy', 'went', 'doctor', 'got', 'full', 'blood', 'test', 'white', 'blood', 'cell', 'red', 'cell', 'cholesterol', 'sugar', 'full', 'allergy', 'almost', 'everything', 'waiting', 'period', 'result', 'took', 'week', 'half', 'wa', 'taking', 'steroid', 'pill', 'allergy', 'got', 'back', 'normal', 'within', '5', 'day', '8th', 'day', 'wa', 'like', 'let', 'u', 'take', 'minocycline', 'want', 'break', 'acne', 'took', 'one', 'pill', 'night', '8', 'day', 'using', 'next', 'day', 'got', 'itchy', 'hand', 'hive', 'realized', 'wa', 'minocycline', 'wa', 'luckily', 'took', 'one', 'pill', 'counter', 'allergy', 'medicine', 'zyrtec', 'got', 'rid', 'back', 'normal', 'around', '8', '9', 'day', 'later', 'gave', 'blood', 'result', 'came', 'doctor', 'everything', 'came', 'normal', 'allergy', 'ever', 'dust', 'completely', 'allergy', 'red', 'blood', 'cell', 'count', 'along', 'came', 'little', 'high', 'nothing', 'else', 'almost', 'say', 'minocycline', 'wa', 'wa', 'doctor', 'told', 'stop', 'taking']"

However, I do consume a fairly high amount of caffeine during the day and I was told to expect this by my doctor.  Another effect that I didn't really connect to the medication was a lack of motivation.  I did not attribute this specifically to the medication until I had a conversation with my best friend who had also taken Wellbutrin at one point.  She asked me specifically if I had experienced diminshed motivation while on the drug and it ""clicked"" with me.  I am not entirely certain if this can be attributed solely to the medication since this is also a symptom of depression.","Overall, I feel that my treatment with this drug has been successful.  I have not experienced any sexual side effects (which I know can occur with some antidepressants).  My libido is exactly the same as it was before my depression and before I began taking this drug.  I know that this drug can also cause a decrease in appetite as well as the urge to smoke.  My husband and I both smoke and I do smoke less when he is not home.  He is not on any medications and so he will frequently ask me if I want to go outside with him and smoke.  Usually (not always) I say yes for the companionship but sometimes I decline.  When he is not home I will smoke approximately 4 cigarettes in an 8-9 hour period (I used to be a pack-a-day smoker).  

Overall, I feel that this is a useful drug for depression.  I began taking it after my father died.  He battled cancer for 3 years and I took care of him the entire time.  His loss was debilitating to me.  No pill is going to change what I went through or how I feel, but this drug has helped me explore some of the painful feelings that go along with his death without ""coming unglued"".  My doctor prescribed this for me and at the same time switched me from Ortho-Tricyclen (which I was highly loyal to) to Loestrin Fe 24.

I have tried multiple amounts of acne medications, but were all ineffective and I suffered more than I did on accutane. Yes, the side effects were odious, but it was nothing that I couldn't handle. The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient.

I am normally a very active person who enjoys exercising daily. While on Lexapro, I found myself preferring to just relax and watch televison (did cause slight weight gain due to this). More serious and traumatizing side effects was the sudden onset of severe chest pain, rapid heartbeat, dizzy spells, sweating, fatigue, numbness in legs and nausea. The first episode occurred one day at work causing an ambulance to be dispatched to job. From that day on, these attacks happened quite frequently, my doctor took me off the medicine. However, these attacks continued to occur for over a year later (never happened to me before Lexapro). In fact, these effects started a two year long string of attacks, visits to cardiologists, emergency rooms, my fear of exercising as increased activity seemed to affect my heart and induce rapid heart beat. I began to fear driving as my dizzy spells would occur for no apparent reason, as well as the numbness in my legs. No doctor was much help, in fact I often got treated as if I was crazy and was just told that I am suffering from panic attacks. I understand that panic attacks can occur out of nowhere in ones life and once you have them you may experience continued anxiety. I believe the Lexapro opened this pandoras box for me though. I read somewhere that an earlier version of Lexapro (or similar type of pill) caused heart problems thus was pulled off the shelves. Who knows the story behind that.

3677,effexor-xr,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"anxiety, mild depression","Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that SNRIs may also increase dopamine transmission. This is because SNRIs work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. If the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then SNRIs will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. Therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex).",Difficulty in reaching orgasm. Increased amount of ejaculate. Rare mild headache.,"My uptake levels were not severely out of balance. I started with 150 mg and felt the positive effects in 20 minutes.

I always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  At 24 years of age I was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  Next came atenolol and labatolol (when I was pregnant).

While I am very eager to be off methadone, I also do not want to rush it.

I have found it to be quite a complex task.","WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN!!  I don't know if it's just because of the methadone slowing your metabolism, or if it is caused by the need to eat sweets but I have gained at least 90 lbs since starting methadone 7 years ago. It is likely a combination of both.  I have also seen a sever decline with my teeth, and the only cause I can think of is methadone.  I have taken such good care of my teeth, as far as self care and making sure I see the dentist every 6 months, and that still hasn't helped.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I have started having sever pain in my joints as well, especially my knees.  I can honestly say though, that without this medication I probably wouldn't be alive to experience any of these minor side effects.  Without a doubt, methadone along with the therapy I received while in the clinic and my families support has saved my life. I will take the weight gain and minor discomfort any day, at least I am here to write about it.","I had tried many times to get sober before beginning MMT.  I started methadone after 3 unsuccessful tries at in-patient and outpatient therapy.  When I first began treatment, I traveled 2 hours a day to received the dosage.  After about a year I was lucky enough to get in to a clinic closer to my home but by that time, I had completed all of the necessary counseling hours and had also received all clean swabs and urine tests and was given 3 day take homes.  Eventually that was extended to 6 days which is the most in my state or clinic that you are allowed. It has been about 7 years now, and I am in a total good place in life and feel that it's time to start tapering.  I have held the same job for almost 5 years, have a car, have my finances somewhat in order and am ready to move on to the next phase.  While I have had a relatively easy time of tapering, I had to stop for a couple of weeks because I started feeling some slight stomach cramping and body aches.  I made the decision to go down 2 mgs a week in hopes that such a small amount per week would allow my body to easily adjust to the change.

Unfortunately no matter when I took it my sleep was also assisted while in my car or at my desk at work! This decreased over time but was still in certain circumstances a danger. I will say however, it did decrease my migraines--the greater my neurontin dose the less my migraines. But I opted to take my migraines over falling asleep driving, possibly killing others or myself.

1593,xanax,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,anxiety/depression,"I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably highger dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.","lethargy, loss of appetite.","I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily.

First of all, the Lexapro caused serious lethargy and loss of energy.  Taking the pill at night rather than in the morning helped with this side effect, as did the addition of Wellbutrin.

After two years on the medication, treatment ended due to inability to tolerate the side effects noted above.  During the weening process, severe dizziness occurred.

The major side effect I noticed was a complete loss of libido and inability to reach orgasm.  Simply put, it was as if a switch had been turned off on my sex drive.  This side effect was the reason I chose to stop taking Effexor.","My physician started me out on 37.5mg/day for 1 week then increased the dosage to 75mg/day for another week and, finally, to 150mg/day.

My physician dropped my dosage back to 75mg/day and that seemed to work best for me.  I absolutely feel that the Effexor helped lift my depression.  However, I eventually chose to stop taking it because of the sexual side effects.  After being on Effexor for about a year, I both wanted and needed to have a healthy sexual relationship with my husband again.  I dropped the dosage back to 37.5mg/day for a week, then one every other day for about another week before stopping altogether.  I don't recall having any ""withdrawal"" symptoms.

Even though I am very opioid-tolerant, it was still sedating for me.  In addition to causing drowsiness and fatigue, it tends to be highly habit-forming.  Because of the strength and nature of the drug, the human body becomes physically dependent on it, which has a few implications.  First, it loses efficacy over time, meaning you need to keep increasing the dosage over time to maintain the same effectiveness. The other issue with physical dependence is withdrawal.  I had severe physical withdrawal symptoms if I waited too long to change the patch (starting a day or so after I was scheduled to change it and becoming more and more severe with time.)  Several specialists I saw actually recommended hospitalization for controlled dose reduction as the safest way to stop taking fentanyl patches because they cause such severe physical withdrawal symptoms.  I withdrew from it completely 3 times, and suffered severe, debilitating symptoms for the first couple of weeks each time with decreasingly severe symptoms lasting for over a month after I stopped using it.  Although I have never had an issue with psychological dependence on any drug, I think it is important to mention that this one can be very addictive (meaning that those who take it frequently develop a psychological dependence, especially if the user is prone to substance abuse.)","I took Duragesic as a long-term maintenance medication on several different occasions, but it can be taken permanently as long as it remains effective.","['extremely', 'effective', 'reducing', 'long', 'term', 'chronic', 'pain', 'nerve', 'especially', 'long', 'acting', 'pain', 'combination', 'break', 'thru', 'medication', 'used', 'spike', 'pain', 'level', 'due', 'fall', 'joint', 'broken', 'bone', 'etc', 'temporary', 'short', 'term', 'increase', 'pain']","['strong', 'highly', 'especially', 'combination', 'drug', 'cause', 'drowsiness', 'even', 'though', 'wa', 'still', 'addition', 'causing', 'drowsiness', 'fatigue', 'highly', 'habit', 'forming', 'strength', 'nature', 'drug', 'human', 'body', 'becomes', 'physically', 'dependent', 'ha', 'first', 'time', 'need', 'keep', 'increasing', 'dosage', 'time', 'maintain', 'effectiveness', 'issue', 'physical', 'withdrawal', 'severe', 'physical', 'withdrawal', 'symptom', 'waited', 'long', 'change', 'patch', 'starting', 'day', 'wa', 'change', 'becoming', 'severe', 'time', 'several', 'saw', 'actually', 'recommended', 'controlled', 'dose', 'reduction', 'way', 'stop', 'taking', 'patch', 'severe', 'physical', 'withdrawal', 'symptom', 'completely', '3', 'time', 'suffered', 'severe', 'debilitating', 'symptom', 'first', 'couple', 'week', 'time', 'severe', 'symptom', 'lasting', 'month', 'stopped', 'using', 'although', 'never', 'issue', 'drug', 'think', 'important', 'mention', 'one', 'addictive', 'take', 'frequently', 'develop', 'especially', 'prone', 'substance']","['took', 'long', 'term', 'maintenance', 'medication', 'several', 'different', 'occasion', 'taken', 'long', 'remains', 'effective']"

Throughout the entire period I have used Duoneb and Zyrtec. I think I was originally put on 250/50 Advair. That was increased, some years back, to 500/50, and about two years ago reduced back to 250/50. At all times I used the Advair twice a day.



My pulmonologist (also primary care physician) was not much help when I developed side effects, nor did he suggest a substitute treatment when I had to stop using Advair.

Onset was rapid and anxiety producing. The extended release did  not work for me. I was tried on a variety of doses, from several small doses through out the day, with minimal effectiveness, to several higher doses per day, up to 20mg 3x a day in combination with Xanax to decrease the anxiety. I was not prescribed Xanax prior to the higher doses of Ritalin. That combination worked better than the previous, but I felt drugged out a lot. So my doctor put me on 20 mg at 6am, and noon, with a small 5-10mg dose in the evening, and Xanax only as needed. I learned to live with the anxiety and work around it. I planned my doses where the onset(1 hour) would occur when I was alone or in only with a small group of people. I had to plan everything around the Ritalin to survive with the anxiety, but it was very difficult. But it was the only way I could keep a job. Without the Ritalin I was unable to concentrate enough at work to remain employed. 



Eventually my doctor retired, and I went to a psychiatrist who has ADHD himself, and he prescribes Adderall, 20mg early morning and noon, and 10 mg mid  afternoon.

My previous thyroid doctor gave me an iodine uptake scan, took my bloodwork and diagnosed me with Hashimotos disease. Thyroid doctor said the best thing was to let my thyroid burn itself out and then he would put me on thyroid medicine, something I now feel was a mistake and should not have been done. Per my initial thyroid doctor, Hashimotos is sometimes hard to stabilize, thus, the Unithroid drug dosage I initially received .75 mcg had to be re-adjusted several times during the first year in order to stabilize my thyroid levels. Dosage was increased to 100 mcg. then to 125 mcg. then increased to 150 mcg. At some point, during these adjustments I went to another thyroid doctor who prescribed the T3 drug called Cytomel which gave me violent heart palpitations and I was taken off of this drug. The last Unithroid prescription dosage re-adustment I was given was for 150 mcg. 1xday 6 days wk with 1/2 dosage to be taken on Sundays. Medication to be taken on an empty stomach every morning. Last year, my body became Toxic to the Unithroid as I hadn't been to see the doctor in a while and had to be taken off the medication entirely for several days. Was restarted at a low dose of 50 mcg. because the toxicity had caused my pulse to race abnormally interupting my daily activities.

I was told that it was the ""most benign medication that I was on"" so I never thought twice about popping that small pill each day.  I suffered from frequent chest infections - that is a side effect of the singulair since it blocks the leuketrines that react and cause inflammation.

However, after my third child, we were broke and I was trying to cut some medications down to save money and I stopped the singulair for a while.

My mind stops trying to jump from one subject to another every second; memory retention/recall improves DRAMATICALLY. I also find it FAR easier to fall asleep at night, seem to sleep better, and seem to be far more emotionally stable. I also do not ""crash"" from it later in the day like my former (stimulant) meds. Also does not appear to be physically addictive.","Severe grogginess, often accompanied by lightheadedness, upset stomach/nausea - ALL aggravated by sleep loss or lack of food, become slightly less severe after I'd been on it again for a couple of weeks. Severe grogginess was slightly alleviated by caffeine (espresso) or some rest (nap) or both. Best solution appears to be to take the meds with or after food, and to attempt to get a decent amount of sleep. Also notice a certain level of dependence (NOT actual addiction though) - mostly due to return of symptoms in medication's absence. I may also have dry mouth, but I'm not sure if that's the meds or if I'm not drinking enough water.","Best way I've discovered to eliminate the side effects is to eat a protein-rich breakfast (usually egg/ham/cheese sandwich for me), then WAIT for at least a few minutes -anywhere from 15 to 60 or more- before taking the medication.

I like that it helps with sleeping quality on top of helping me focus, remember, and feel more aware of surroundings.

3281,zoloft,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,depression,Emotions were somewhat blunted. Less moodiness.,"Weight gain, extreme tiredness during the day, insomnia at night, bad effect on libido and sexual ability. Extreme lethargy.","I was on Zoloft for about 2 years total. I am extremely sensitive to medication, so I started at a dose of 25 mgs. and slowly titrated up to 100 mgs. I was unaware that this was probably too high of a dose for me. It subsequently caused me to start taking other prescriptions to mitigate some side effects. My doctor prescribed Ritalin and Focalin for the lethargy and fatigue side effects that I experienced during the day, and Ambien for the insomnia that Zoloft caused. I am still on Ambien to this day. 



The worst effect of Zoloft came when I tried to get off of it. It was total, utter hell. I have since found out that this is euphemistically called, ""discontinuation Syndrome."" 



I first cut the dose down to 50 mgs. and did not experience problems. I then slowly titrated down over several months until I came off of it completely. Over the next few weeks, I started experiencing strange, tingling sensations down my body, panic attacks, (which I had never experienced before), and extreme nausea - which became so bad, I lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks. This was all extremely traumatic as I am a type 1 diabetic who needs to eat to balance the insulin I take. The panic attacks got so bad, I had to be on Xanax XR everyday for months. I could not function normally or work. I tried to stick it out because I didn't want to go back on an SSRI after all the trouble and side effects it caused. I went to a MD who was also an alternative care specialist, thinking he could give me St. Johns Wort and I could manage with that until I got over the physical side effects of the SSRI, but it didn't work. I eventually had to go back on an SSRI just to function normally. I am on Lexapro now. I managed to be drug free for the first 40 years of my life (except for insulin), and now because of the aftermath of Zoloft, I am on Ambien, Lexapro, and Valium occasionally for anxiety. To top that off, the alternative doctor put me on a supplement that ended up being an anabolic steroid (which he called a 'nutritional supplement' and I ended up having to go on even more medication to fight the side effects that I incurred from that. All because of Zoloft. I will regret taking it the rest of my life.","['emotion', 'somewhat', 'le', 'moodiness']","['weight', 'gain', 'extreme', 'tiredness', 'day', 'insomnia', 'night', 'bad', 'effect', 'libido', 'sexual', 'ability', 'extreme', 'lethargy']","['wa', 'zoloft', '2', 'year', 'total', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'medication', 'started', 'dose', '25', 'mg', 'slowly', 'titrated', '100', 'mg', 'wa', 'wa', 'probably', 'high', 'dose', 'subsequently', 'caused', 'start', 'taking', 'prescription', 'side', 'effect', 'doctor', 'prescribed', 'ritalin', 'fatigue', 'side', 'effect', 'experienced', 'day', 'ambien', 'insomnia', 'zoloft', 'caused', 'still', 'ambien', 'day', 'worst', 'effect', 'zoloft', 'came', 'tried', 'get', 'wa', 'total', 'hell', 'since', 'found', 'called', 'discontinuation', 'syndrome', 'first', 'cut', 'dose', '50', 'mg', 'experience', 'problem', 'slowly', 'titrated', 'several', 'month', 'came', 'completely', 'next', 'week', 'started', 'experiencing', 'strange', 'tingling', 'sensation', 'body', 'panic', 'attack', 'never', 'experienced', 'extreme', 'nausea', 'became', 'bad', 'lost', '20', 'pound', '6', 'week', 'wa', 'extremely', 'type', '1', 'need', 'eat', 'balance', 'insulin', 'take', 'panic', 'attack', 'got', 'bad', 'xanax', 'xr', 'everyday', 'month', 'could', 'function', 'normally', 'work', 'tried', 'stick', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'ssri', 'trouble', 'side', 'effect', 'caused', 'went', 'md', 'wa', 'also', 'alternative', 'care', 'specialist', 'thinking', 'could', 'give', 'john', 'could', 'manage', 'got', 'physical', 'side', 'effect', 'ssri', 'work', 'eventually', 'go', 'back', 'ssri', 'function', 'normally', 'lexapro', 'managed', 'drug', 'free', 'first', '40', 'year', 'life', 'except', 'insulin', 'zoloft', 'ambien', 'lexapro', 'valium', 'occasionally', 'anxiety', 'top', 'alternative', 'doctor', 'put', 'supplement', 'ended', 'steroid', 'called', 'supplement', 'ended', 'go', 'even', 'medication', 'fight', 'side', 'effect', 'zoloft', 'taking', 'rest', 'life']"
